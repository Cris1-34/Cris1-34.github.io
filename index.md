* Lab 2, Part-2

    What I really enjoyed about Lab 2 part 2 is how fun it was to try to figure the lab out. Since we were starting out, it was a nice challenge. While doing this lab I learned how to use strings such as “cout” and “cin”. I also leaned how to use variables as a way to simplify writing code.


* Lab 4, Part-1

    What I really enjoyed about lab 4 is how the conversions worked. It seemed really useful to learn. What I learned in lab 4 was how  “.h” files can help out code. I also learned how to use different containers for numbers such as “double”. I knew that learning containers would be more important in the future.


* Lab 7, Part-1

    What I enjoyed of doing lab 7 has to be how complex it is. You have to use the ".h" file to help out with the ".cc" file. What I learned in Lab 7 has been about statements, arguments, and functions. With a new function such as "stoi". This has helped me learn more on how to make a program show different variables.
